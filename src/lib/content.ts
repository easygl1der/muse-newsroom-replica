  "Muse is a personal AI agent. It doesn’t just answer questions, it actually does the work. It helps people stay on top of things, takes tasks and projects off their plate, and turns long-term goals into action plans.",
  "Meta built Muse from the ground up to be a safe, secure, private, and widely available personal AI agent.",
  "Muse runs on Muse Secure VM, a dedicated secure computer with its own browser, and can work on a person’s behalf across the apps they use daily, learning from conversations, reflecting on what matters to them, and getting sharper along the way.",

export const SECURITY_POINTS = [
  "Muse runs on its own dedicated computer in the cloud, contained so no one else’s agent can reach it. That is where Muse lives and where the data and credentials for any service a person connects are securely stored.",
  "A separate Sentinel agent runs on that same machine, kept apart from Muse at the system level. Nothing Muse does reaches the internet unless the Sentinel approves it, and it asks the person for permission when needed.",
  "Muse has no visibility into people’s passwords or payment methods. Any credentials a person shares go into secure storage, so Muse can use them without seeing them, including passwords a person types into the browser themselves.",
  "Muse checks with the person before sensitive actions like sending an email or making a purchase. Muse shows people a complete audit trail of everything it has done and plans to do.",
  "People choose which apps Muse connects to and exactly how much access it gets. For things like email, people choose what Muse can do, whether it reads their mail or can also send on their behalf.",
  "People can change access or disconnect a service whenever they want. People can also opt out of their interactions being used to train Meta’s AI models.",
  "Muse doesn’t share a person’s conversations or the data in their VM with Meta’s ad systems.",
  "Muse remembers what matters to a person, and they can always tell it to “forget” specific things it’s learned.",
